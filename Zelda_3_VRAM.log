byte: [$0000 - $1fff]
word: [$0000 - $0fff]
    
    BG2 Tilemap

================================================================================

byte: [$2000 - $3fff]
word: [$1000 - $1fff]
    
    BG1 Tilemap

================================================================================

byte: [$4000 - $7fff]
word: [$2000 - $3fff]
    
    4bpp Tiles for BG0 and BG1 [They share :) ]. Sometimes known as BG CHR.

================================================================================

byte: [$8000 - $bfff]
word: [$4000 - $5fff]
    
    Sprite Graphics Memory
    
    Sprite graphics can be seen as divided in half. Areas that have 0's as
    sprite indexes will not overwrite the graphics from the previous screen.
    This can cause inconsistent behavior though, so be careful.
    
    byte: [$8000 - $87ff]
    word: [$4000 - $43ff]
        
        Reserved Sprite Memory (Slot 0)
        
        This region contains Link's body's current sprites, as well as various
        other essential sprites that can't easily be taken out of memory.
        e.g. rupees, the sword and shield, etc.
        
    byte: [$8800 - $9fff]
    word: [$4400 - $4fff]
        
        Locale Specific Graphics (Slots 1 - 3)
        
        "Locale" in this sense can be one of three things: Dark World, Light World, or 
        inside a Dungeon. This will determine what the pots and bushes you pick up look like,
        (rocks as well) 
    
    byte: [$a000 - $bfff]
    word: [$5000 - $5fff]
        
        Room / Area Specific Graphics (Slots 4 - 7)
        
        Every overworld area and dungeon room has a graphics number that tells the game
        which sprite graphics to load dynamically.

================================================================================

byte: [$c000 - $dfff]
word: [$6000 - $6fff]

    BG3 Tilemap
    
    This is the Heads up Display and Menu, etc.

================================================================================

byte: [$e000 - $ffff]
word: [$7000 - $7fff]
    
    2bpp Tiles for BG3
    
    byte: [$f800 - $ffff]
    word: [$7c00 - $7fff]
        
        VWF rendered tiles go here. This is generated-at-runtime CHR that is
        in and of itself the current three lines of text that you can see in a
        message.
        
    - note that graphics packs 6A, 69, and 68 are used with srctypeone for this
